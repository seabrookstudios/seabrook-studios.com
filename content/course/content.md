# Course Booklet
## READING COURSE SHEETS
This booklet contains a collection of exciting courses for you to play. We designed the courses to show off the different game modes and to offer you a challenge. Our fantastic Kickstarter supporters have created the rest.

You need to set up the course on your table before play. This page will tell you how to read the course sheets that help you set up any course.

## Course Sheets
On the next page is a course sheet. If you want to view a digital version of the course sheet, scan the QR code in the bottom left corner. The table size details are also in the bottom left corner. This graphic tells you how much space on your table this course will fill.

Along the top of each sheet are the course name, the designer and the length of the course. The length is, if you were a tiny, tiny golfer and were playing on this course, how far your ball would need to travel along all the fairways.

In the course overview is the par score information. When playing Stroke Play, you will use the par score. For Stableford, we express par as a range. At Donut Sands, 32 is what you should be aiming for, and 85 is the best possible score. The Solo score is the par score for your solo chaos golf deck. The first time you play this course in solo mode, build your deck to this score. For more information on the different game modes, see the rule book.

In the middle of each course sheet is the layout of the tiles. Each tile has an ID and a triangle that indicates the direction relative to the bottom of the course.

The green shaded tile contains the tee box for the first hole. Place your golfers on the tee box at the start of the game.

Below the course map on some courses are rows of hexes that contain adjustment tiles. Adjustment tiles either add, replace or remove hazards.

## BUILDING THE COURSE
If you are playing with others, you can divvy up the tasks. You’ll set up much quicker.

### FIND TILES
First up, look at the tiles listed in the bottom left corner of the course sheet. These are the ones you will need to recreate this course. 

### PLACE COURSE TILES
Start placing them down on the table working from one side to the other, furthest from you to closest. Please pay attention to the rotation of each tile as you place it. The red triangle in each hex on the course map indicates what direction it needs to face. Rotate the tile until the small arrow (bottom right of course tile) points in the same direction.

### PLACE ADJUSTMENT TILES
Below some courses is a diagram showing the placement of adjustment tiles. Donut Sands has seven course tiles that need adjusting. There are 4 kinds of adjustment tile each displayed using a single letter and colour. Bunker (B, yellow), Water (W, blue), Tree (T, purple) and Rough (R, green).

Find each course tile using its ID and then place a matching adjustment tile on top covering up one of the small hexes on the course tile. The hexes displayed in the adjustment diagram are always oriented away from you. On the course diagram, hexes that have adjustment tiles are shown in orange.

### PLACE FLAGS
Some of the tiles have green circles on them, each with a number. Place the flag with the corresponding number on the green on that tile. If a course tile has more than one green, the lowest-numbered green is the one where the fairway comes over the tile edge.

### COURSE DETAILS
Course name, designer and course length (based on physical course tile size).

Also includes par scores for the various game modes that use it

The difficulty can be used to compare the relative difficulty between two courses. The higher the number, the greater the challenge.

### ADJUSTMENT TILES
Which course tiles need adjusting, where to place the adjustment tile and which hazard.

### TABLE SPACE
Approximately how much table space you will need to setup this course. 

### QR CODE
Scan this to view a digital version of this course sheet.

### COURSE LAYOUT
The tiles arranged for the course. Each tile has a number (e.g. 25A) which corresponds to the number in the bottom-right of the physical tile.

The red triangle is the orientation of the tile. 

The green numbered circle corresponds to each flag number.

### COURSE TILES
Sorted list of tiles you need to build the course.

## Course Index
While you can use every course in this book for any game mode,  some are more suited to specific game modes. This constraint is most relevant to the Chaos Golf and Kelly Golf variants. You can still use most other courses for these modes and the main difference is that the game will likely take longer. The courses that have 9 holes or have long snaking arrangements will not be as fun when playing Chaos Golf based variants.

In the table below, a value of Yes indicates the course was designed with the course modes in mind. A value of No indicates they are unsuitable. A dash indicates that while it the course was not specifically designed for that mode, it should be playable.

On the next page is the Starter Course, use this for your first game of Match Play before embarking on a longer course.

# Quick Course Setup
Use this guide when you want to create a new course quickly.

## SETUP
Take the large hex tiles and split them into three stacks according to the tile type icon in the bottom right. There are three icons, a golf ball on a tee for tee boxes, a flag for greens and a tree for fairways.

You don’t need to change the tiles if they are not all a-side or b-side. Some tiles belong in different stacks depending on which side is face up.

## LAYOUT YOUR FIRST HOLE
### tee box
Take a top tile off the tee box stack and place it on the table. This tile is the first tee. On it are two pieces of information. The first is the par score used in Stableford. The second is how many additional tiles the hole needs. This label will be one of: “No tiles”, “1 tile” or “2 tiles”.

If the tee box says “no tiles” skip straight to the green section.

### fairway
Take the required number of tiles off the fairway stack and decide which one you want to place first. Connect it to the fairway that is crossing over the edge of the tee box tile. If you have a second fairway tile, connect it onto the first fairway. You can rotate the tiles any way you want as long as the fairways link.

All you need now is a green and a flag.

### green
Take the top tile off the greens stack and connect it to the fairway to finish off the hole. Take the 1st flag and place it on the green.

## CONTINUING THE COURSE
Start the second hole by drawing a new tee box tile and placing it adjacent to the green tile of the first hole. Repeat the process with fairway and green tiles. 

If at any point you run out of fairway tiles, skip them. At any time you can swap out a harder tile for an easier one. Look in the bottom right corner of a tile, the more stars, the harder it will be.

Continue until you have placed all 18 Holes. You can go in any direction and make whatever shape you want. One thing to note, the more narrow your course is, the harder it tends to be as the amount of out-of-bounds increases.

## Adjustment TILES
Use these tiles to adjust the difficulty of a course. Every adjustment tile has a rough hazard on the back face that you can use to remove a hazard. Place the tile on the hazard you want to convert to rough.

The other side is either a bunker, a water hazard or trees. Use this to change a hazard (e.g. from water to bunker) or to make the course harder by adding hazards. For a tough game, place trees over the corners between three course tiles.

## TREES
There are 14 trees in the box you can use as decorations and make the tree hazard more prominent. Take these and place them on the first 14 tree hazards on the course.
